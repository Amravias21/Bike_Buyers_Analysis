# Bike Purchase Dashboard Dataset

This repository contains a dataset comprising details of 1000 users from diverse backgrounds, focusing on whether they purchased a bike or not. The dataset is specifically curated for building a dashboard using Google Sheets. It includes essential columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike.
