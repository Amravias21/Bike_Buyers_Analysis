Overview
This repository contains a dataset with details of 1000 users from various backgrounds, focusing on whether they purchased a bike or not. The dataset is intended for use in building a dashboard using Google Sheets. The data includes columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike. Some NA (Null/Empty) values have been intentionally injected into the dataset, and the goal is to perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to help business stakeholders make informed decisions.

Dashboard Features
1. Bar Chart (Marital Status)
Question: How does the count of bike purchases vary among different marital statuses? Are married individuals more likely to purchase bikes?

2. Bar Chart (Gender)
Question: Build a bar graph to compare the count of male and female customers. Does gender influence bike purchases, and if so, to what extent?

3. Histogram (Income)
Question: What is the distribution of income among bike buyers? Are there specific income brackets that show a higher likelihood of bike purchases?

4. Histogram (Age)
Question: Create a histogram to understand the age distribution of bike buyers. Are certain age groups more inclined to purchase bikes?

5. Box Plot (Income)
Question: Identify outliers in the income distribution of bike buyers. Are there any extreme income values, and how might they impact purchasing behavior?

6. Pie Chart (Region)
Question: Represent the distribution of bike purchases by region using a pie chart. Are there regions where bike purchases are notably higher?

7. Scatter Plot (Income vs. Age)
Question: Create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between income and age. Do individuals with higher incomes tend to be in specific age groups?

8. Stacked Bar Chart (Marital Status & Gender)
Question: How does the distribution of bike purchases differ when considering both marital status and gender simultaneously? Are there notable patterns?

9. Correlation Heatmap (Numeric Variables)
Question: Use a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix between numeric variables. What variables show a strong correlation, and how might this influence purchasing behavior?
